# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-With-JavaFX\
This is a visualization project for 5 data structure including queue, stack, array, binary search tree, hashmap.\
i used some animations to move around nodes on screen, and used javafx gui library for drawing components onto screen.\
****Warning****\
Development process of this project is still ongoing. There are some bugs exist in bst data structure. insertion and deletion operations have some issues.\
when you insert new entry in bst, some nodes may overlap, and the late one may cover previous nodes, in order to prevent collision i am thinking about\ 
narrowing each space between nodes at the same level as long as tree goes deeper.\
When you delete some entry from bst node the node itself will be removed but connecting lines will stil remain. I think this is beacuse lines and circles\
has no connection at all and when you do a deletion operation, bst only will remove circle from scene.\
****warning****\
****How to run project****\
This project has not used any 3rd party library but only used javaFX. Modern jdk's are generally come with javaFX inside them so you don't need to include\
javafx library seperately. But if you are using an old jdk, you might want to include javaFX library.\
